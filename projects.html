                <div>
                    <p>CountOnMe is the result of Macathon, a 24-hour annual innovation and creativity competition organized by my college. My teammates and I designed an app disguised as a calculator that enables victims of domestic violence to find secure help in critical moments. I envisioned the technical aspects, helped conduct background research, and prepared the presentation. The app is still in the design phase, but we have received positive feedback and were featured on the <a class="resume_link" href="https://www.startribune.com/in-24-hour-marathon-macalester-students-devise-app-to-protect-domestic-violence-victims/600157319/">Star Tribune</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>In my Software Design and Development class, my teammates and I designed Card Safe, a fully functional mobile app that stores gift cards. Over the course of seven weeks, I learned Flutter and Dart and used them to create the database that stored the cards, conduct software testing, and explore ways to use APIs to build the app. Since the class was entirely remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the work was done asynchronously. </p>

                <div><p>
                    Inspired by a video that went viral in 2020 in Brazil, I developed an app using Java and Android Studio that allows clients to schedule hairdresser appointments with Cabeleireira Leila. It contains a portfolio of previous hair and nails works, and it sends an email to the client with the details about their appointment. Although I  built it in a humourous manner, this app was an interesting way I found to learn native Android Development. </p>

                    My first project ever was Renegotiating Debts. I created it as my Internal Assessment for my Computer Science class when I was still in High School. Inspired by a previous job, Renegotiating Debts is a software built with Java that intends to be a replacement for the spreadsheets that my employer used to calculate interest for its clients' debts. Based on how old the debt is and its value, the software calculates the updated values and dates based on the company's policies. </p>    </div>
