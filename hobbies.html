            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            
            <p>

                I started hiking at UWC-USA, the international high school I attended in New Mexico. Since my first trip, I have spent, in total, almost two months hiking and camping. I enjoy being in contact with nature, seeing animals in their natural environment, and the sense of community I feel when I hike in a group. Personally, it is a way to release stress and find joy in the small things around me.</p>
            
            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            
            <p>

                For a long time, preparing my meals was a source of anxiety and stress. However, after I left the meal plan my college offered, I had no other choice. Slowly, I became comfortable cooking and baking, and now it is one of the activities I enjoy doing the most. I find a lot of pleasure in knowing exactly how my dishes are prepared and seasoned. My favorite dishes to make are chicken pie, lentils with carrots, and any Brazilian food. </p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            
            <p>

                Growing up, I was always surrounded by books. I started reading when I was four and I have several memories of the time I spent on public libraries, avidly turning pages. My favorite genres are science fiction, drama, and adventure and the most fascinating piece I have ever read is “Story of Your Life,” by Ted Chiang. Reading allows me to develop empathy as well as gain a broader understanding about the world and its inhabitants. </p>
